# Changes Summary

## Issue
The user was getting the message "You haven't connected your YouTube account or you don't have any playlists" when accessing the dashboard, despite having YouTube API credentials in the .env file.

## Root Cause
The application was missing the implementation for the YouTube OAuth authentication flow. While the YouTube service was properly configured to use the API credentials, there was no way for users to authorize the application to access their YouTube account data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created YouTubeAuthController
Created a controller to handle the YouTube OAuth flow:
- `redirect()` method: Redirects users to the Google authorization page
- `callback()` method: Handles the callback from Google, exchanges the authorization code for an access token, and stores it in the session

File: `/app/Http/Controllers/YouTubeAuthController.php`

### 2. Added YouTube Authentication Routes
Added routes for the YouTube authentication flow:
- `auth/youtube`: Redirects to the YouTube authorization page
- `auth/youtube/callback`: Handles the callback from Google

File: `/routes/web.php`

### 3. Updated Dashboard View
Added a "Connect YouTube Account" button to the dashboard when no playlists are found, allowing users to initiate the OAuth flow.

File: `/resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`

### 4. Created YouTube API Setup Guide
Created a comprehensive guide for setting up the YouTube API v3 credentials and connecting a YouTube account to the application.

File: `/YOUTUBE_API_SETUP.md`

## How to Use

1. Follow the instructions in the `YOUTUBE_API_SETUP.md` guide to set up your YouTube API credentials
2. Make sure your .env file contains the correct credentials
3. Start your application
4. Log in to your account
5. Go to the dashboard
6. Click the "Connect YouTube Account" button
7. Follow the Google OAuth flow to authorize your application
8. After successful authorization, you should be redirected back to the dashboard where your YouTube playlists will be displayed

## Technical Details

The implementation uses the standard OAuth 2.0 flow:
1. The user clicks the "Connect YouTube Account" button
2. The application redirects to the Google authorization page
3. The user authorizes the application
4. Google redirects back to the application with an authorization code
5. The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token
6. The access token is stored in the session
7. The application uses the access token to fetch the user's YouTube playlists

The access token is stored in the session under the key `youtube_access_token`. In a production environment, you might want to store it in a more persistent storage like a database.
